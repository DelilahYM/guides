## Instructor Notes

Windows -- Git Bash (Cygwin, PowerShell, Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL))

Mac OSX -- Terminal

Linux -- Shell

### Setup

https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/setup.html

Download [shell-lesson-data.zip](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/data/shell-lesson-data.zip) and store the file on your __Desktop__



You can follow the lecture writeup, but do focus on the shell (terminal) :) 

### Introducing the Shell (10:10)

GUI vs CLI

for a literature search, you have to copy the third line of one thousand text files in one thousand different directories and paste it into a single file.

BASH

```
$ cat /etc/shells
```

Change Shell:

```
$ chsh -s /bin/bash
```

prompt -- $ (#, %) -- shell is waiting for input/command

```
$ Command + Options + Argument
```

```
$ ls
```

Nelle, biologist

She has 1520 samples that sheâ€™s run through an assay machine to measure the relative abundance of 300 proteins. 

She needs to run these 1520 files through an imaginary program called `goostats.sh` she inherited.

write a paper

use gui is mundane task 



In order to achieve her task, Nelle needs to know how to:

- navigate to a file/directory
- create a file/directory
- check the length of a file
- chain commands together
- retrieve a set of files
- iterate over files
- run a shell script containing her pipeline
