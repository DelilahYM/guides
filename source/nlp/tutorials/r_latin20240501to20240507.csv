I wonder what are the phonetical differences between Classical Latin, Late Latin and Medieval Latin (Vulgar Latin non included). Or did Medieval Latin have any specific pronuncation at all, or did it just depend on the speaker's accent ?

Can someone please type out for me, in Latin (and, if possible in English), **the few words before and after the highlighted word ""Vilna""?** In 1323 the Grand Duke of Lithuania, Mindaugas, wrote this letter and a few others. I understand the context of this letter and I know in later letters Vilna is referred to as a ""royal city"" etc, thanks to other historians' typing out the text.

However, I don't read Latin and can't decipher the text to even understand what the words are in this letter to begin deciphering. **I'm just concerned with how Vilna is described**.

5,benjamin-crowell,1714578071,1chp9yq,0,1,"I've written some open-source software called Ifthimos ([1](https://bitbucket.org/ben-crowell/ifthimos), [2](https://bitbucket.org/ben-crowell/lemming), [3](https://bitbucket.org/ben-crowell/ransom)) for Greek morphology. It's basically meant to be a modern replacement for the Greek portion of the old Morpheus code. (Morpheus is no longer viable IMO.) On the Latin side, there are two open-source programs I'm aware of that can be used for Morpheus's functionality, which are Whitaker's Words and Collatinus. Words is old but has a healthy community of competent people maintaining it. Collatinus is newer and also seems like solid work. My Greek code is working fairly well now as a replacement for Perseus's Hopper or Scaife, and I'm continuing to debug and improve it through the process of reading Xenophon.

One thing that was really nice about Morpheus, and technically impressive, was that it handled Greek, Latin, and Italian all under one roof. The other projects I've mentioned are language-specific, which is why, for example, NoDictionaries (which is based on Words) only does Latin and not Greek. I've been looking at the source code of Words and Collatinus and thinking about whether there is any reasonable way to make both Greek and Latin functionality available through a consistent interface. There are technical issues involved, such as the fact that Ifthimos, Words, and Collatinus are all written in different computer programming languages, but I don't think those are insuperable. As I try to think of what would work, one thing that is holding me back is that I know zero Latin, and in particular I don't have any insight yet into whether the algorithms used by the Latin code could be applied to Greek or vice versa. I'm not wedded to all my own methods of parsing Greek words, and it could be that I should switch over some of my methods to be more like the ones used by the Latin codes.

Can anyone help me out with some insight into how the morphologies of Greek and Latin compare? Some obvious trivial points is that they're both Indo-European, and the way they inflect nouns and verbs is broadly similar, but Greek has a much more complex writing system.

Greek verbs have pretty complicated morphology, which is not particularly easy to program a computer  to understand. For instance, the machine has to be able to make some kind of good guess as to whether a certain verb is a compound, add and remove augments (which come after any prefix), know that ἵστημι actually has an alpha hidden in its stem, and recognize contracted verbs. Do Latin verbs have this much going on?

Casually looking through the documentation for Words, I see that while Whitaker was still alive, he seemed to feel that his work was lacking in terms of vowel lengths, and he was working on improving that. Is the situation similar to the one in Greek, where endings have predictable vowel lengths, but stem vowels don't, and vowel length can affect the written form of the word? I don't mean macronization, which is just a modern textbook thing, but, e.g., the fact that in Greek you may not be able to figure out what kind of accent to put on a vowel without knowing its length based on a dictionary.

For Greek, a computer parser's job is made more difficult by the fact that there were many different dialects, and they often used different inflections. E.g., the augment is optional in Homer but not in classical Greek, and Herodotus writes ἀπικομένος rather than Attic ἀφικομένος. Only once you get into the koine era is there more of a global standard. Is literary Latin any more or less standardized than Greek in terms of morphology?

What I've noticed is a common trait in Romance languages, whereby nouns generally evolve from the same declension. 
For example, man in Portuguese (homem), Spanish (hombre), French (homme), Italian (uomo), all come form the accusative form ""hominem"". 

At first I thought this might have been due to word frequency; it makes sense that hominem would have been used more often than homo.

47,CharcoFrio,1714723713,1cj3b3b,0,1,"I speak decent, if rusty, Spanish. I can read short stories by Borges, understand Spanish audio, and have basic conversations.  
  
I'd like to learn Latin for fun.  
  
Here's what I'm thinking.  
  
I want to learn to express myself simply with a small core vocabulary.  
  
I would like to start out basically imitating Spanish, speaking a simple style of Spanish with Latin words, just to get used to the declensions and conjugations. Once I can do that, I'll try to gradually speak a bit more polished and idiomatically.

I'll also keep redundant vocab small, to start with, in my own compositions: so if you can say ""and"" with et, -que, ac, atque, et cetera -- I'll just use ""et"" and maybe ""-que"" and not worry about the others. If ""or"" can be ""vel"" or ""aut"", I'll just pick one to use in every case, at first.

IDIOMATIC CORE CONNECTIVE VOCABULARY

The stuff that connects all the nouns, verbs, and adjectives in Spanish is generally of a fixed form and just needs to be memorized. Lots of books list nouns and verbs, but are there any good lists of this sort of stuff in Latin?

e.g.

con tal de que, siempre que  
mientras, mientras tanto  
tal, tales  
aunque, a pesar de que

tener que, hay que, es necesario que  
ir a

VERBS

I'll simplify at first: e.g. poner and tener in Spanish texts will be teneo and pono in Latin, even if there is a more accurate, more idiomatic option.

I might even, at first, use Spanish idioms until I learn the Latin ones: e.g. use teneo + infinitive perhaps to express obligation and necessity, before I learn how to properly do it in Latin.

NOUNS and ADJECTIVES

There are five noun declensions, right? and adjectives show case, gender, and number (up to 36 word forms).

I think to get myself used to all the changes, I'll pick noun - adjective pairs and practice listing the forms.

e.g.

puer parvus, vir fortis, pila caerulea, virgo pulcher, gladius acer

I am a strong man. vir fortis

I threw a blue ball. pilam caeruleam

The next step would be to translate the sentences entirely.

After that, I would translate short passages from Spanish into simple Latin.

TENSES

I plan to follow Spanish use at first, i.e. imperfect narrates or describes the past, preterite interrupts the action. I think that there are less tenses in Spanish than Latin, as they were simplified. Any guidance here would be welcome.

I know the exam is extremely difficult and hard to prepare for, but I wanted to explain my situation and ask what my chances are for doing well on the AP exam in May 2025.

I'm at the end of my sophomore year right now, took a year of latin in school but have to drop it next year to take the IB program. My teacher was great and we finished the first two books of cambridge latin course. Not to sound cocky, but I found the first year of latin really easy and my teacher offered for me to skip a year or two, which I had to turn down since I'm dropping the class. I'm nearly fluent in french (taken classes for 9 years) and find that a lot of the grammar and vocabulary translates over. So far, this has made learning latin a whole lot easier for me and I hope it will continue to be. My mom took latin in college and can tutor me with grammar but is also willing to do some of the AP reading along with me. I've also already read the Aeneid in english and Book 1 of the Gallic wars in latin (though I used a dictionary along the way), if that's worth mentioning. 

  
Before you say anything, I completely understand the time commitment this will take and I'm motivated and willing to work every day at it. My tentative plan is to spend this summer working extensively on my vocabulary and grammar with CLC Book 3 and Wheelock's latin and then to start the AP readings next fall in alignment with the class. Although I won't be in his class, the latin teacher at my school is willing to help me and point me towards resources for the exam.

The only correlation I am seeing is this occurs when the name comes later in the sentence, as though it's possibly done if the person in question isn't the subject of the sentence. Or perhaps when there are two subjects in a sentence.

Also, how does it work with a work like āēr? Where both of the vowels in the diphthong are long? Would you simply pronounce it like a diphthong, but pronounce it with twice the length? Or would you again pronounce both vowels as separate?

DECENTIVS IN PACEM
QVI VIXIT · ANNIS · V · MENSES · VI · DEPOSITVS
DIE · XIIII · KALendas · APRILES ·

narthex of S. Sabina, Rome)

Sourced from [this](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/churches/S.Sabina/interior/narthex/inscriptions/Decentius.html) website.

In the above link, the author points out how the inscription has ""IN PACEM"" instead of the expected ""IN PACE,"" which can only mean, according to the author, that it's ""an out right mistake"" or ""something more intriguing: that in the minds of the Christian parents who commissioned this stone or of the man who cut it, the peace of death is not a state, but a process towards which we move."" 

So, onto my question: if the latter is true, should the inscription be read as saying that peace is at the end of the process of whatever is after death, or is it trying to suggest that the individual is already in peace after death, and 'going further in' in some sense? 

I'm not sure if this makes any sense or not. I ask because there's an idea in Orthodox Christianity that theosis (process of becoming more like God) continues even after death, I wanted to see if this is an early reference to this.

The teacher translated this as follows: “Like Romulus obtained the kingdom through the augury, when the city was yet to be founded.”

Now I constantly look to the margins for help like a beached whale, and since I’ve gotten so good at using the notes, it feels like consulting an English dictionary rather than learning from context.

Does Roman aeterna hit a peak in difficulty and become easily comprehensible at some point?

111,Captain_Grammaticus,1715104618,1cmi4rw,0,1,"I was shown this last Saturday at a course at my local educator's college. In the meantime, I found out that Birkenbihl also worked as esotericist and claimed to be able to find the best Hash Browns in Kansas City, even if she's never been there, relying on her psychic powers. I hope this doesn't discredit this method too much.

The method is fairly consistent with  some ideas that I've seen when it comes to Comprehensible Input and Natural Methods. Why ""brain-friendly""? It taps into the brain's natural talent to associate, play, imitate, compare, categorise new information, such as vocabulary.

It works in four phases:

1) ""Decoding"": Students are given a short text in the target language with a very close interlineary gloss in their L1. They establish meaning, discuss new words etc.

2) ""Active listening"": The students listen to a slow recording of the original text while following the gloss. They do this three or four times, until they are comfortable with only hearing the text and without relying on the gloss. Instead or additionally to a recording, a choral reading or similar activities are possible.

3) ""Passive listening"": The students listen passively to a recording of the text while they are busy with other things.

4) ""Learning activities"". More activities around vocabulary training, discussing the text, quizzes, etc. Most importantly, to arrange vocabulary items into categories, or associate them with overarching themes.

My own impression from trying this out today with my students is that it really makes learning more fun and less of a chore, compared to Grammar-Translation. So, yay! Also, the colleague who showed us this method said, that she didn't really have to write preps at home anymore, now that she did all the recordings and glosses.

However, when I compare this method with things I've seen elsewhere, I see this: This method seems closely related with what I've seen on Keith Toda's blog and elsewhere, where a lesson plan is divided into ""pre-reading activities"", where new vocabulary and structures are established and trained, a ""reading activity"", and ""post-reading activities"" that make students engage with the text from different angles. The listening and passive listening phases seem to be an Ersatz for contact with actual speaker of the target language; and with texts like those from LLPSI where every new word is well understandable from context and accompanying drawing alone, the Decoding phase, becomes almost trivial.

My conclusion is that our Teacher Örberg and his LLPSI still reigns supreme in secula seculorum, but that this brain-friendly method makes working with more grammar-translation oriented textbooks a lot more rewarding.","A method for teaching (and learning) Latin that I was shown a few days ago: Vera Birkenbihl's ""Brain-friendly learning""",https://www.reddit.com/r/latin/comments/1cmi4rw/a_method_for_teaching_and_learning_latin_that_i/,2024-05-07 13:56:58

113,matsnorberg,1715101448,1cmgwj7,0,1,"I know that Google Translate is not good at Latin but today I decided to test it on a text I had some problems with. It's a text from the 1700's by some Ludvig Hollberg. I took some paragraphs and entered them into Google Translate to see what would come out.

It's not completely garbage but there are some nonsense. Let me say that Google Translate is my last resort when I'm unrelentlessly stuck and haven't a clue of how to proceed. The translator is no answer key but yet it may give me some clues that I can use to move on. I give the translation below so you can evaluate it.

Do you guys sometimes use translators in your study work? It would be fine if you could comment on the quality of the translation.

***Roterdami videbam circa vesperam pueros e ludis literariis dimissos lapides jaculari in statuam Erasmi Roterodamensis fallendi temporis gratia, solitum illis exercitium.***

In Rotterdam, I saw about evening that the boys, released from the literary games, were throwing stones at the statue of Erasmus of Rotterdam, for the grace of time, the usual exercise for them.
[I don't know how to translate fallendi temporis gratia]

***Non tam miratus sum petulantiam puerorum quam incuriam eorum, quorum intererat licentiam ejusmodi refrenare.***

I was not so much surprised at the impudence of the children as at the carelessness of those whose interest it was to restrain such a license.
[I think ""of those who whwre at the pace to restrain those liberties"" is a better translation].

***Indigna mihi prorsus videbatur monumenti istius profanatio, quod debuit esse sacrum non solum Roterodamensibus sed etiam toti literato orbi, ob meritum Viri, cuius cineres exosculari debet posteritas.***

The desecration of that monument seemed to me utterly unworthy, which ought to have been sacred not only to the people of Rotterdam but also to the whole literate world, for the merit of a Man whose ashes posterity must exhume.
[Does cineres refer to memories here; ashes doesn't really make sense literally]

***Proficiscor Roterdamo Antverpiam, ubi divertebar apud virum Hamburgensem, quem Amstelodami noveram quique Nidrosiae aliquot annos habitaverat.***

I set out from Rotterdam to Antwerp, where I spent time with a man from Hamburg whom I had known in Amsterdam and who had lived in Nidrosia for several years.
[Nidrosia is Nidaros in Norway]

***Naviculam ibi conscendi, qua Bruxellas vectus sum.***

There I embarked on a boat, in which I went to Brussels.

***modico tantum impendio steterat iter Amstelodamo Bruxellas, sed reliquum itineris, deficientibus aquaeductibus, altero tanto mihi constiturum verebar.***

the journey from Amsterdam to Brussels had been made at a small expense, but I was afraid that the rest of the journey, owing to the failure of the aqueducts, would have to be arranged for me by another so much.
[mini constiturum verebar is a bit cryptic]

***Hinc aliquot dies Bruxellis manebam calculos positurus***

From here I stayed a few days in Brussels to lay the stones
[Making plans makes better sense]

***imitamur nos stultitiam Gallorum, quidni etiam bona instituta amplectamur, qualia sunt frugi esse, cum frugalitatem suadeat paupertas, ac pedibus ire, cum nihil in arca sit, quo conducamus currus.***

let us imitate the folly of the French, and do we not also embrace good institutions, such as being thrifty when poverty suggests frugality, and going on foot when there is nothing in the chest with which to hire a carriage.

***His argumentis inductus pedestri itineri me accingo, sacinulas imponens rhedae.***

118,cruelflesh,1715068925,1cm6k5e,0,1,"Hello, 

I am trying to make myself a self-study plan to learn Latin but I am not quite sure how to go about it yet so I would like your thoughts on this. I do believe I have some advantages already that will make the learning easier: my native language is French, and I am fluent in Italian. 

I've been told to firstly start with the grammar basics. For that I've been recommended *Wheelock's Latin*. 

Then cement those basics with Ørberg's *Familia Romana* and *Ritchie's Fabulae Faciles* (and perhaps coupled with audio versions so I can familiarise myself with the sound of the language).

And move to North &amp; Hillard *Latin Prose Composition* as well as *Bradley Arnold's Latin Prose Composition* all while continuing the readings above?

I had some people recommend me Duolingo's Latin course, but I am not quite sure about the quality of it? I've heard mixed things about it so I am still unsure.
